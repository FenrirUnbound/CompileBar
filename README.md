CompileBar
==========

What is it?
-----------
CompileBar is my submission solution to an internship I'm intending to apply
for at IGN. It contains 4 answers to the questions delivered by IGN, where the questions can be found at ign.theresumator.com/apply/QXoWqD/CodeFoo-Challenge.html (if the questions are still posted, that is).
