Name: Darren Matsumoto


Brief Bio:

IGN's First Fridays inspired me to take a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
Attending school taught me C/C++, Java, Python, and Shell Scripting.
The passion to code and programing pushed me to learn how to develop on
the iOS and Android mobile devices. Life showed me that a hammer doesn't
make the best screwdriver, so I use the best tools for the job at hand.
Decades of playing video games granted me the knowledge that if you take
out all the bad, all you have left is the good.
